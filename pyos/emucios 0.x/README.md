PyOS is mostly cross-platform. The only part that will likely need to be rewritten is the kernel itself and the stdio library, which bypasses the kernel-level IO abstractions. A few programs may depend on system configuration and need to be rebuilt, but for the most part it should work without much modification.

stdio assumes that it is running on top of an ANSI-compatible terminal, and both the kernel and stdio rely on a certain way that the filesystem must be presented, which is a strange dictionary/iterator setup. The filesystem is stored as nested FileSystem objects, which are subclassed dictionaries, and each file is represented as a generator that iterates through all the characters in the file. Files can be written to one character at a time by setting the value of the filename in the dictionary to each character. Only the first character of any given string will be used, and only strings may be used.
